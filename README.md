# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding the user's needs helps the development team prioritize which features to start with.  Communication between the Product Owner, the stakeholders, the Scrum Master, and the developers is key to ensuring the entire team is on the same page. User stories help prioritize tasks based on user value, allowing the team to deliver the most valuable features and meet the user's needs. User stories give us a direct understanding of the user's needs, what we are building and why, who is intended to use it, and what they will do with it. User stories can easily be updated and adapted based on the feedback gathered. Breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable parts helps for better collaboration between developers and stakeholders.


# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development programs by clearly identifying the goal of my program and what functions are needed to achieve it. I will need to gather information about the user needs and the expected features and create a project plan. The agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work would be a daily stand, prioritizing user stories based on requirements that have been given through feedback from stakeholders. I would also like to foster a collaborative team culture where everyone is encouraged to contribute and give feedback throughout the entire process. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development means actively contributing and collaborating. You need to be open to feedback and be clear in communicating any ideas or concerns you may have that may result in the success of the product. A good team member should be flexible and willing to adjust to changing requirements, priorities, and feedback. A good team member takes ownership and is accountable for their work while having a positive mindset to help foster a successful product.
